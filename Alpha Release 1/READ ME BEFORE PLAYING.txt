Hi there, and thanks for checking out my first prototype of Regression!

This game is designed to have negative player progression - hence the name - so instead of enemies getting tougher, you instead will become weaker.
I am aware that there are still many bugs.

Controls:
WASD - Move your character
Left click - shoot
Press the escape key to pause the game at any time!

Once you have finished playing around, please complete the google form linked in the other text document.

Known issues:
If you die in wave 2, you may be able to still move around.
If you pause the game mid-way through a wave transition, you may immediately exit the game.
Movement is only in one direction, even if multiple buttons are pressed.
Enemy hitboxes are slightly buggy, and some projectiles may go through.
Enemy animations are buggy, and may randomly freeze.
The enemies can damage each other.

Thank you for playing! :)
