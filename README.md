# Regression

## Introduction
Regression is a first person 3D game, where you fight hordes of enemies from the Devil himself. You start imbued with many powers, ranging from double damage to inflating the size of enemies. However, you have been cursed by the Devil. The curse inside you grows as you progress through the game, and you have to channel this curse into powers. These powers are then removed, decreasing your power. Can you make it to the end, or will you succumb to the curse?
## Features
-   13 different powers, with a vast array of effects ranging from double health to being able to extinguish fires.
    
-   4 difficulties - each with their own benefits and drawbacks. Harder difficulties will make decisions for you - so you never know which power you're going to lose!
    
-   Full OST and sounds throughout.
    
-   Points system - Gain points for killing enemies, dealing damage to the final boss, and for draining specific powers. The earlier you drain stronger powers the higher bonus points you will recieve! Strategy is key to insuring you get the highest possible score.
    
-   Four unique enemy types will test your skills. These enemies are weak, but appear far more powerful in later rounds.
    
-   Two different weapons - Will you use the staff which allows you to damage enemies from far away, making it easier to dodge enemies, or use the mace which gives you a damage reduction and deals far more damage than the staff, but in exchange for having to get much closer to the enemies.
