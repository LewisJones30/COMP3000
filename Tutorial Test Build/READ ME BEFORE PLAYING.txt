Full control scheme is below:

WASD - Move around the area.
Move the mouse to look around.
Left click - shoot.
Escape - Pause/Unpause game. Only possible when you can control the camera.
While in tutorial, press F12 if you want to skip it.
You can reset the tutorial progress (it only runs every time before you complete it for the first time) on the main menu.

KNOWN ISSUES:
On main menu after completing tutorial, there is no way to leave using a button (press escape to leave!)
On main menu after completing tutorial, the start for hard difficulty does not work.
Projectiles may not hit the enemies correctly. This will be addressed soon.
